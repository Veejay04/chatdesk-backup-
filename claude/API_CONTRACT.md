# ChatDesk API Contract — v0.1 (Sprint 1 Baseline)

Covers: Authentication, the unified dynamic User model, FAQ Knowledge Base management, Inquiry Logging (AI chat history), and the Core Ticketing Escalation workflow. Advanced OpenAI intent context injection, analytics aggregation, and SUS evaluation reporting are NOT in this version — they will be handled in Sprint 2.

This is the agreed shape that the Django backend developer will build against, and the React Native (mobile) and ReactJS (web) developers will consume. Changing a field name or endpoint path after the sprint starts requires updating this file and notifying the other devs — don't silently drift.

## Conventions
- Base URL: /api/v1/
- All request/response bodies: JSON
- Auth header: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 UTC (2026-06-17T10:00:00Z)
- List endpoints are paginated:

{
  "count": 128,
  "next": "/api/v1/tickets/?page=2",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [ ... ]
}

- Error shape (consistent across all endpoints):

{
  "error": "validation_error",
  "message": "Invalid request parameters.",
  "details": { "email": ["This field must be a valid email address."] }
}

- Non-field errors (e.g. wrong login password) come in details.non_field_errors -
  show that to the user, not the generic "Invalid request parameters." message.
- Rate limits: some endpoints are throttled (noted per endpoint). Over the limit
  returns 429 with error "throttled" and a message saying when to retry:
  { "error": "throttled", "message": "Request was throttled. Expected available in 42 seconds.", "details": {} }

## Authentication

### POST /api/v1/auth/register/
Public. Creates a student account. admin accounts are created manually via the Django superuser terminal by the system administrator. Note: Students can register using ANY valid email address (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.); it is not restricted to the USTP domain.

Request:
{
  "email": "student@gmail.com",
  "password": "securepassword123",
  "first_name": "Jefferson",
  "last_name": "Booc",
  "school_id": "2021-00123",
  "course": "BSIT"
}
Response 201:
{
  "user": { 
    "user_id": 1, 
    "email": "student@gmail.com", 
    "first_name": "Jefferson",
    "last_name": "Booc",
    "role": "student", 
    "course": "BSIT",
    "school_id": "2021-00123"
  },
  "access": "jwt_access_token_string",
  "refresh": "jwt_refresh_token_string"
}
# school_id must be unique - register returns 400 with a school_id validation
# error if it's already taken (same pattern as the email uniqueness check).
# password must pass the full password rules (not too common, not all numbers,
# not too similar to the name/email, 8+ characters) - 400 under details.password.
# A verification email is sent. If Gmail fails to send it, the account is NOT
# created and the response is 503:
# { "error": "email_delivery_failed", "message": "We couldn't send your verification email...", "details": {} }
# Dev fallback: only when DEBUG=True and no Gmail App Password is configured,
# the response also includes "dev_verify_url" instead of emailing it.
# Optional backend settings (both off by default): ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS limits
# registration to e.g. ustp.edu.ph (400 under details.email);
# REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION blocks student login until the link is clicked.
# Throttled: 10/hour per IP.

### POST /api/v1/auth/login/
Public.
Request: { "email": "string", "password": "string" }
Response 200: Same shape as the register response.
Response 400: reason in details.non_field_errors - "Invalid email or password.",
"This account has been deactivated.", or (only with REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION)
"Please verify your email address first...".
Throttled: 20/min per IP and 10/min per email.

### POST /api/v1/auth/token/refresh/
Public (requires valid refresh token).
Request: { "refresh": "jwt_refresh_token_string" } → Response 200: { "access": "new_jwt_access_string", "refresh": "new_jwt_refresh_string" }
# Refresh tokens rotate: the old one is blacklisted the moment it's used.
# Clients MUST store the new "refresh" from every response - reusing the old
# one returns 401 (this is what logged users out ~30 minutes after login).

### POST /api/v1/auth/verify-email/resend/
Public. Emails a fresh verification link (older links stop working). Always
the same response, whether or not the email belongs to an unverified account.
Request: { "email": "student@gmail.com" }
Response 200: { "message": "If that email belongs to an unverified account, a new verification link has been sent." }
# dev_verify_url is included under the same DEBUG-only fallback as register.
# Throttled: 5/hour per IP and per email.

### POST /api/v1/auth/logout/
Auth required. Blacklists the refresh token.
Request: { "refresh": "jwt_refresh_token_string" } → Response 205.

### GET /api/v1/auth/me/
Auth required. Returns the current authenticated user's profile.

### PATCH /api/v1/auth/me/
Auth required. Lets a student or admin edit their own first_name/last_name/
profile_picture (role, email, is_active, and school_id stay untouchable via
this endpoint). Send multipart/form-data (not JSON) when including
profile_picture. Response is just the fields you can edit, not the full
User Profile shape - re-fetch GET /auth/me/ if you need the rest.

Request (multipart/form-data):
first_name=Jefferson&last_name=Booc&profile_picture=<file>
Response 200: { "first_name": "Jefferson", "last_name": "Booc", "profile_picture": "http://<host>/media/profile_pictures/xyz.jpg" }
# profile_picture: max 2 MB (400 under details.profile_picture otherwise).
# Stored as a JPEG shrunk to fit 512x512.

### POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/request/
Public. Mobile "Forgot Password" step 1. Emails a 6-digit code (10 min expiry)
to the account if one exists and is active. Always responds the same way
regardless of whether the email is registered - never confirms/denies
account existence.

Request: { "email": "student@gmail.com" }
Response 200: { "message": "If that email is registered, a password reset code has been sent." }
# Only the newest code is valid - requesting a new one cancels older ones.
# A new code can be requested once per 60 seconds per account.
# If Gmail fails to send, the response is still this same 200 (so it can't be
# used to discover which emails have accounts); the failure is logged.
# Dev fallback: only when DEBUG=True and backend/.env has no Gmail App
# Password, the response also includes "dev_code": "123456". It is never
# returned with DEBUG=False.
# Throttled: 20/hour per IP and 5/hour per email.

### POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm/
Public. Mobile "Forgot Password" step 2. Verifies the emailed code and sets
a new password. Code is single-use; a successful reset invalidates any
other outstanding codes for that user.

Request:
{
  "email": "student@gmail.com",
  "code": "123456",
  "new_password": "newsecurepassword123"
}
Response 200: { "message": "Password has been reset. You can now log in." }
Response 400 (wrong/expired/already-used code, or unknown email):
{ "error": "validation_error", "message": "Invalid request parameters.", "details": { "code": ["Invalid or expired code."] } }
# A code stops working after 5 wrong guesses (request a new one).
# A successful reset signs the user out of every existing session (all their
# refresh tokens are blacklisted).
# Throttled: 30/hour per IP.
# Not on the original ERD - tbl_password_reset_code added post-Sprint-1-baseline
# to support this flow; flagged for the team to fold into the next ERD revision.

## User Profile (Referenced by other endpoints)
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "email": "student@gmail.com",
  "first_name": "Jefferson",
  "last_name": "Booc",
  "role": "student",
  "course": "BSIT",
  "school_id": "2021-00123",
  "profile_picture": "http://<host>/media/profile_pictures/xyz.jpg",
  "is_active": true,
  "last_login": "2026-07-20T09:12:00Z",
  "created_at": "2026-06-15T08:00:00Z"
}
# Note: course and school_id are nullable for admin accounts. school_id is
# unique per user (added post-Sprint-1-baseline; not on the original ERD -
# flagged for the team to fold into the next ERD revision). is_active and
# last_login are Django's built-in AbstractUser fields, now surfaced for the
# admin User Management screen below - last_login is null until the user's
# first login after this field started being stamped. profile_picture is
# null until the user uploads one via PATCH /auth/me/ (see above) - also not
# on the original ERD, flagged for the same future revision.

## User Management (Admin Dashboard)
Admin only. Manages the same tbl_user accounts students log into on mobile -
deactivating a user here immediately blocks their next login attempt.

Method,Path,Notes
GET,/api/v1/users/,"List users. ?search= (name/email), ?role=student|admin, ?status=active|inactive."
POST,/api/v1/users/,"Create a student or admin account directly (admin picks the role; distinct from public self-registration)."
GET,/api/v1/users/{user_id}/,Detail view.
PATCH,/api/v1/users/{user_id}/,"Edit first_name/last_name/role/course/school_id/is_active. An admin cannot deactivate or demote their own account (403)."
DELETE,/api/v1/users/{user_id}/,"Remove an account. An admin cannot delete their own account (403)."
GET,/api/v1/colleges/,"Any authenticated user. Colleges and their course codes, for college filters (not paginated): [{ ""key"": ""it_computing"", ""name"": ""Information Technology & Computing"", ""courses"": [{ ""code"": ""BSIT"", ""name"": ""BS Information Technology"" }] }]"
# Input rules (register, PATCH /auth/me/, admin create/edit - 400 under the field):
# - first_name / last_name: must contain letters, max 150.
# - school_id: 6-20 digits, hyphens allowed, starts and ends with a digit
#   (e.g. 2023304440 or 2026-00006); unique.
# - password (register + admin create): full password rules, as in register.

## FAQ (Knowledge Base)
{
  "faq_id": 105,
  "user_id": 2, 
  "intent_keyword": "scholarship_requirements",
  "question_text": "What are the requirements for the academic scholarship?",
  "answer_content": "To apply for the academic scholarship, you must submit your Certificate of Registration, a 2x2 ID picture, and your previous semester's grades to the OSA office.",
  "category": "Scholarship",
  "created_at": "2026-06-10T09:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-06-15T14:30:00Z",
  "updated_by": 2
}
category enum: Enrollment, Scholarship, Clearance, Discipline, General.

Method,Path,Roles,Notes
GET,/api/v1/faqs/,all,"List FAQs, supports ?category= filter."
POST,/api/v1/faqs/,admin,Create a new FAQ entry.
GET,/api/v1/faqs/popular/,all,"The FAQs students ask most (chat quick actions). ?office= narrows to that office's FAQs + uncategorized ones; ?limit= (default 3, max 10). Not paginated: [{ ""faq_id"": 105, ""question_text"": ""..."" }]"
GET,/api/v1/faqs/{faq_id}/,all,Detail view.
PATCH,/api/v1/faqs/{faq_id}/,admin,Edit FAQ (automatically updates updated_at and updated_by).
DELETE,/api/v1/faqs/{faq_id}/,admin,Remove obsolete FAQ.
# Validation on create/edit: answer_content must be at least 15 characters
# (students see it word for word - no placeholders like "OSA ONLY"), and
# question_text/answer_content must not contain the broken character "�"
# (usually from copy-pasting). intent_keyword: 2-100 letters, numbers or
# underscores, no spaces. question_text: max 300. All return 400 under the
# field name.

## Chat Interaction & Inquiry Logging
This handles the core AI interaction. The frontend posts a message, the backend hits the OpenAI API, logs the interaction in tbl_inquiry_logs, and returns the response.

## POST /api/v1/chat/ask/
Auth required (Student). Throttled: 20/min per student.

Request:
{
  "message": "Pano mag apply ng scholarship?",
  "office": 3,
  "history": [
    { "role": "user", "text": "whats the process of enrollment" },
    { "role": "assistant", "text": "Enrollment Process for Freshmen..." }
  ]
}
# message: required, max 1000 characters (400 under details.message).
# office: optional - the office picked in the category selector.
# history: optional - the current chat's earlier turns, oldest first (max 20;
# the app sends the last 6) so follow-ups are understood in context.

  "ticket_ai_resolved": true
}
# Every real question gets a ticket. An FAQ answer is recorded as a ticket
# already resolved by the AI (ticket_ai_resolved: true) - it is NOT in the
# staff queue; the student can ask for staff follow-up on it (see
# POST /tickets/{ticket_id}/follow-up/). Greetings, gibberish, off-topic and
# clarification prompts create no ticket.

# detected_intent is an FAQ's intent_keyword when answered, otherwise one of:
#   conversational        - greeting/thanks/"is that all?" - short fixed reply, no ticket
#   needs_clarification   - vague school question; suggested_questions holds up to 3 FAQ
#                           questions to offer as buttons (sending one verbatim is answered directly)
#   off_topic             - not about school - short scope reply, no ticket
#   unclear               - gibberish - asks to rephrase, no ticket
#   unresolved_complex_query - new ticket created (201)
#   duplicate_ticket      - same concern as one of the student's open tickets (200);
#                           no new ticket, ticket_id/ticket_code/ticket_title point to the existing one
# is_answer: true only for FAQ answers - the only replies that can be rated.

### PATCH /api/v1/chat/logs/{log_id}/feedback/
Auth required (Student, own logs only - others 404).
Request: { "feedback": "up" } or { "feedback": "down" }
Response 200: { "feedback": "up" }
Response 400 if the log isn't an FAQ answer (is_answer false).

# ticket_code: office code + Manila date (MMDDYY) + that office's 3-digit
# number for the day, e.g. OSA103126001 = OSA's first ticket on Oct 31, 2026.
# "GEN" when the ticket has no office yet. Set once on creation and never
# changes, even if the ticket is rerouted. Unique.
# is_ai_resolved: true for the record of a question the chatbot answered from
# an FAQ (created already resolved, issue_description ends "- Answered by
# ChatDesk.", resolution = the FAQ answer). It becomes false once a student
# asks for follow-up or staff reply to it.
# reopened_at: when the student asked for staff follow-up on an AI-answered
# ticket; staff resolution time is measured from here (otherwise created_at).
# resolution: the admin's written answer, set via PATCH alongside status. Null
# until an admin responds. Not on the original ERD - added post-Sprint-1-
# baseline to fulfill the "add resolution notes" PATCH behavior already
# described below; flagged for the team to fold into the next ERD revision.
# title: short AI-generated label shown with the number ("Late Enrollment Fee
# Waiver - Ticket #890"); "General Inquiry" if none could be generated. Admins
# can edit it via PATCH. conversation_context: the chat turns right before an
# AI escalation, read-only, empty for manual tickets. Neither is on the
# original ERD - flagged for the next ERD revision.

# total_inquiries / total_escalations / intent_frequencies count only real
# questions (FAQ answers + escalations). Small talk, clarification prompts,
# off-topic, gibberish and repeats of an open ticket are in other_interactions;
# total_messages counts everything.
# tickets_by_status, resolution_rate and avg_resolution_seconds cover staff
# tickets only; chatbot-answered tickets are counted in ai_answered_tickets.
# offices: one row per office (plus an "Unassigned" row with office_id null
# when it has tickets), most pending work first; Office Admins get only their
# own office. Resolution times are from reopened_at (if any) or created_at.

## Other endpoint behavior notes
- Offices have a "code" (2-10 uppercase letters/numbers, unique) that starts
  their ticket codes. Optional on create/edit - left blank, one is generated
  from the name (e.g. "Registrar" -> REG). Changing it doesn't change
  existing ticket codes.
- DELETE /api/v1/offices/{office_id}/ returns 400 (with a message) while the
  office still has Office Admin accounts - reassign them first. An Office Admin
  with no office gets 403 / empty results everywhere.
- Announcements: title and content required (not blank), content max 5000.
  Phases: name required (max 100), guidance_message max 500, at most 5
  suggested_questions of up to 200 characters each.
- Phases may overlap. GET /api/v1/phases/current/ uses today's Manila date and,
  when several phases are active, returns the most recently started one (the
  shorter one on a tie).
